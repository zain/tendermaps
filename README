This is the code that powers http://tendermaps.com/. The site itself is completely static, generated by tendermaps.py which is run periodically (every 5 seconds). Whenever tendermaps.py finds a new scan in the IN_FOLDER, it will be loaded, chopped, geo-tagged, zipped together with its description, and saved to OUT_FOLDER.
